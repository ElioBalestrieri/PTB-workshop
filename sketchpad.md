# Rough roadmap of topics

## Day 1

#### things to check at very beginning:
1. refresher on variable types
3. basic statements: for, while, if
2. logical operators & indexing 
 

#### pros and cons of functions

PRO: modular, reusable (if coded smartly), make the overall code cleaner, 
force to break up tasks in smaller pieces, easier to ask chatgpt to code them,
faster (especially local functions)

CON: debug, risk of proliferation of functions




## Day 2

remember to talk about try/catch statements and their importance
- close ptb (with or without a catch)
- temp save
